# Dark
Proof Of Concept Python3 DDos Net - Powered By A API


# What is Dark?
 - Dark is a POC Python3 API Powered Net.
 - I made it to show that nets can be created in different languages other than GO.
 - I didn't want to add too much functionality to this as people might actually use this in malicious purposes or try and skid it


# How does it work?

- The attacker connects to the net using a raw TCP client such as PuTTY.
- Then the attacker uses the "attack" command to launch a attack on the victim using a DDoS API ( Most of the time these APIs are spoofed or have multiple dedicated servers)
- The victim gets attacked by the API and the Net tells the attacker that the attack has been launched.


# Botnets

- This is NOT a botnet.
- You could make it a botnet by adding a rat of some type into a stub and making individual computers slaves.
- This however would be a lengthy process.
- IF you want to do this and need help please contact me on Discord (Swev#9999 or swev#9999)
